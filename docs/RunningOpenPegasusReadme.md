# Running and Configuring OpenPegasus

## Starting and stopping the server.

The OpenPegasus server is a single executable that requires only
minimum set of environment variables to execute.

The required environment variables required are those that define the runtime
location for the server/client executablesslibraries, location
of SSL keys, trust directories,  crl directories,
and the CIM class repository for the server.

Normally all these are created under a single directory, **PEGASUS_HOME **
which is defined for the build

* **PEGASUS_HOME** - Target directory for compile output; contains object/executable files
for OpenPegasus as part of the build and other
components required for the running OpenPegasus are included in this directory
and its subdirectories as part of the setup.  Thus, binary files, the class repository,
the directories for certificates and certificate revocation lists, any trace
output, are normally placed in subdirectories of **PEGASUS_HOME**. Normally all
of the components of the build and runtime data are built under the
single **PEGASUS_HOME** Directory

The command to start the server is :

    cimserver <runtime options>

    where each runtime option is defined as

       name=value

    name is the name of the option
    value is the value to be set.

    Runtime options are those options defined for the
    for OpenPegasus in the `cimconfig` command CLI.

Thus:

    cimserver traceLevel=2 traceComponents=XMLIO

Starts the server with the cimconfig runtime options set to
trace the execution of the server at trace level 2 and to
trace only the component XMLIO.  This is set as a current
option definition so that the option is defined only for the
current execution of the server.

In addition, the run environment must be able to find the executables
for the server, client executables, etc.  Thus the path to the
binaries for OpenPegasus should be included in the PATH environment variable.

    export PATH=$PEGASUS_HOME/bin:$PATH

Finally the location of the libraries may need to be known. The
environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH covers that. For example:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PEGASUS_HOME/lib64:

## Configuring the CIMServer

The OpenPegasus CIMServer run configuration is controlled by the
options define in the CLI `cimconfig`, see
[OpenPegasus Runtime Options section](#openPegasus-runtime-options) .
They may be set either as planned (static) options (the value is
retained in the server CIM Repository, is applied at the next sever startup and
is persistent through server start and stop) or current options where
they are set only in the current execution of the server.

`cimconfig` is a command line client that can set or unset any of the
OpenPegasus runtime configuration properties, show the current status of each of
the runtime configuration properties.

The options may also be modified through the WEBAdmin facility if it is
enabled.

The syntax of the `cimconfig` command is:

```
cimconfig --help
Usage: cimconfig -g name [ -c ] [ -d ] [ -p ]
                 -s name=value [ -c ] [ -p ] [ -t ]
                 -u name [ -c ] [ -p ] [ -t ]
                 -l [ -c | -p ]
                 -H name | "All"
                 -h
                 --help
                 --version
Options :
    -c         - Use current configuration
                 it is the default optional option for options like -l
    -d         - Use default configuration
    -g         - Get the value of specified configuration property
    -H         - Get help on specified configuration property
                 (or all configuration properties with keyword "All"
    -h, --help - Display this help message
    -l         - Display all the configuration properties
    -p         - Configuration used on next CIM Server start
    -s         - Add or Update configuration property value
    -u         - Reset configuration property to its default value
    -t         - Timeout value in seconds for updating the current or
                 planned value
    --version  - Display CIM Server version number

Usage note: The cimconfig command can be used to update the next planned
    configuration without having the CIM Server running. All other options
    except -h, --help and --version of the cimconfig command require that the
    CIM Server is running.

```

Thus the following command sets the traceLevel to the integer 5 in the
current settings:

    cimconfig -s traceLevel=5 -c

The following command resets the traceLevel to the default value

    cimconfig -u traceLevel -c


### OpenPegasus Runtime Options

The options are documented both in the help for the `cimconfig -H ALL` cli,
in the documentation for OpenPegasus
[docs/BuildAndReleaseOptions.md](docs/BuildAndReleaseOptions.md).

The following is the list of cimconfig run time variables as documented
in the `cimconfig` CLI with the command `cimconfig -H ALL`.

Options defined as static are enabled only when the server is
restarted. Dynamic options may be modified when the server is running.

```
authorizedUserGroups (Static,Default:)

If set, the value is list of comma-separated user

When setting this option 'hostname' should be set also.

hostname (Static,Default:)

Override local system supplied hostname CIM Server uses to
build objects for WBEM operations that return hostname (ex.

period expires, CIM Server shuts down, even with CIM operations
in progress. Minimum value is 2 seconds.

   validates client certificate, but the connection is accepted if no
   certificate or an untrusted certificate is sent. Server will

## Installing and controlling providers in OpenPegasus

See the Admin guide at OpenPegasus/pegasus/doc/Admin_Guide_Release.pdf

## OpenPegasus WEB Adminstration

Some characteristics of OpenPegasus can be manipulated through a WEB
WEB page managed by OpenPegasus (webadmin).
The existence of the WEB adminstration pags is controlled by the build
environment variable PEGASUS_ENABLE_PROTOCOL_WEB, which is 'true by
default'. To disable it set PEGASUS_ENABLE_PROTOCOL_WEB=false.

There is a readme `OpenPegasus/pegasus/webadmin` that provides more information
on WEBAdmin.

## Gathering and viewing Operation Statistics

OpenPegasus  is capable of gathering statistics on requests executed
including request and response size, number of operations executed, execution
time. This capability is normally disable but may be enabled by setting
a property in the CIM_ObjectManager instance within OpenPegasus.

The cli tool can set this property with the command `cimcli son` or turn
off statistics with `cimcli soff`. The pywbem python tool pywbemcli can
also enable this with its statistics commands.

Note that the statistics gathering is always not persistent, it is
disabled on server startup so it must be reenabled on each restart of
the server.

The file `OpenPegasus\pegasus\readme.statistics` provides more information
on statistics in OpenPegasus.

## OpenPegasus command line utilities

* cimauth - Cli for authorization manaagement. add, modify, remove or list
  CIM user authorizations.
* cimcli - Command line client to execute requests against the WBEM server.
* cimcrl -  Manage the certificate revocation list.
* cimconfig - Manage OpenPegasus run-time parameters.
* cimperf - Display performance information when server statistics are enabled.
* cimtrust - Manage server and indication listener certificates.
* cimmofl - MOF compiler for OpenPegasus. Compiles MOF directly into the
  currently defined server CIM repository. Generally this compiler should only
  be used to build a new CIM repository
* cimmof - MOF compiler for OpenPegasus. Compiles MOF by using the compiler
  as a WBEM client and sending the requests to create/modify/delete CIM
  classes and objects to the WBEM server.
* cimprovider - Provider management. Disable, enable, remove or list
  registered CIM providers or CIM provider modules and module status. For help
  there is an html file with the source code.
* cimsub - Command line to to manage CIM Subscriptions.
* cimuser - Manage users if PEGASUS_PAM_AUTHENTICATION functionality not
  compiled into OpenPegasus. Otherwise nto build


In general these tools have a --help option to get help with parameters and usage.

See the directory `OpenPegasus\pegasus\src\Clients` for list of all of the
client test and usage tools for OpenPegasus.
