    Description (
       "CIM_Account is the information held by a SecurityService to "
       "track identity and privileges managed by that service. Common "
       "examples of an Account are the entries in a UNIX /etc/passwd "
       "file. Several kinds of security services use various "
       "information from those entries - the /bin/login program uses "
       "the account name ('root') and hashed password to authenticate "
       "users, and the file service, for instance, uses the UserID "
       "field ('0') and GroupID field ('0') to record ownership and "
       "determine access control privileges on files in the file "
       "system. This class is defined so as to incorporate "
       "commonly-used LDAP attributes to permit implementations to "
       "easily derive this information from LDAP-accessible "
       "directories. \n"
       "\n"
       "The semantics of Account overlap with that of the class, "
       "CIM_Identity. However, aspects of Account - such as its "
       "specific tie to a System - are valuable and have been widely "
       "implemented. For this reason, the Account and Identity classes "
       "are associated using a subclass of LogicalIdentity "
       "(AccountIdentity), instead of deprecating the Account class in "
       "the CIM Schema. When an Account has been authenticated, the "
       "corresponding Identity's TrustEstablished Boolean would be set "
       "to TRUE. Then, the Identity class can be used as defined for "
       "authorization purposes.")]
