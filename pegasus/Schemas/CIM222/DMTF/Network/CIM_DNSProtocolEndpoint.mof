       "A class derived from CIM_ProtocolEndpoint which represents the "
       "DNS client and DNS configuration for a single IP endpoint. The "
       "DNS server addresses can be determined by querying the "

       "order in which the DNS servers will be queried can be "
       "determined by the relative values of the OrderOfAccess "
