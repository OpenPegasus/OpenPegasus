    Description ( 
       "This relationship defines a context (e.g., a System or "
       "Service) of a Credential. One example is a shared secret/ "
       "password which is defined within the context of an application "
       "(or Service). Generally, there is one scoping element for a "
       "Credential, however the multiplicities of the association "
       "allow a Credential to be scoped by more than one element. If "
       "this association is not instantiated for a Credential, that "
       "Credential is assumed to be scoped to the Namespace.\n"
       "This association may also be used to indicate that a "
       "Credential is valid in some other environment. For instance "
       "associating the Credential to a RemoteServiceAccessPoint would "
       "indicate that the Credential is used to access the remote "
       "service." )]
