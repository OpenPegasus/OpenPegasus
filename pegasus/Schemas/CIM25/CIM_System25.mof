   [Association,  Aggregation, Description (
     "A ComputerSystem can aggregate another ComputerSystem. "
     "This association can be used to model MPP Systems with "
     "workstation frontends, an I2O subsystem embedded in a Unitary"
     "ComputerSystem, or a System that splits functionality between "
     "two processors, potentially running different Operating"
     "Systems. For example, if a CISC Processor and its associated "
     "OperatingSystem, are used for user interface and file "
     "support, and a RISC Processor and its OS are used for complex "
     "mathematical operations, this could be modeled as two "
     "ComputerSystems where one aggregates the other. In some cases, "
     "this could be modeled as a Cluster. The difference is the "
     "focus of the relationship. ComponentCS represents that "
     "unique and distinct ComputerSystems are aggregated by a "
     "higher level CS object. However, each of the component CSs are "
     "still distinguishable entities and are only viewed as such. "
     "Alternately, with a Cluster, the ComputerSystems that "
     "participate in it are inconsequential, when viewed through the "
     "'Cluster System'.\n\n"
     "When instantiating or subclassing the ComponentCS "
     "relationship, care should be taken that the component "
     "ComputerSystem meets the definitional requirements of a "
     "ComputerSystem - ie, a functional whole that provides "
     "compute capabilities and aggregates System Devices, an "
     "OperatingSystem, etc.") ]
