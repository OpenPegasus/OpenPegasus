This directory contains the final version of the MOF files that are
considered the offical DMTF CIM schema 2.5.  This set of files was
updated from the preliminary version of CIM schema 2.5 to the final
version on 7 August 2001.  The Preliminary version had been released in
December 2000 and the Final version of the schema released in
June 2001.

Note that the changes between preliminary and final include changes to
many of the files for both formatting and actual corrections and also
removed one file (networkadd.mof) and added a file (systemadd.mof).

This is to be considered the "official" stable DMTF MOF CIM schema as of
June 2001.
