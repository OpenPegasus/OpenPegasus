       "A subclass of StatisticalData which identifies individual "
       "statistics for an element of a block storage system. This "
       "class defines the metrics that MAY be kept for managed "

      [Required, Description ( 
          "Defines the role that the element played for which this "
          "statistics record was collected. If the metered element "
          "is a system or a component of a system associated to a "
          "RegisteredProfile, then that profile may provide a more "
          "specialized definition and additional usage information "
          "for this property. \r\n"
          "Generally, the ElementTypes defined here have the "
          "following meaning in the context of this class: 2, "
          "\"Computer System\": Cumulative statistics for the "
          "storage system. In the case of a complex system with "
          "multiple component Computer Systems, these are the "
          "statistics for the top-level aggregate Computer System. "
          "3, \"Front-end Computer System\": Statistics for a "
          "component computer system that communicate with systems "
          "that initiate IO requests. 4, \"Peer Computer System\": "
          "Statistics for a component computer system that "
          "communicates with peer storage systems e.g. to provide "
          "remote mirroring of a volume. 5, \"Back-end Computer "
          "System\": Statistics for a component computer system "
          "that communicates with back-end storage. 6, \"Front-end "
          "Port\": Statistics for a port that communicates with "
          "systems that initiate IO requests. 7, \"Back-end Port\": "
          "Statistics for a port that initiates IO requests to "
          "storage devices. 8, \"Volume\": Statistics for an "
          "exposable storage extent, such as a StorageVolume or "
          "LogicalDisk. 9, \"Extent\": Statistics for an "
          "intermediate storage extent, i.e. an extent that is "
          "neither a volume or a disk. 10, \"Disk Drive: Statistics "
          "for a StorageExtent that is associated to a DiskDrive "
          "through the MediaPresent association. 11, \"Arbitrary "
          "LUs\": Statistics that derive from access to Logical "
          "Units that are NOT StorageVolumes (e.g., controller "
          "commands). 12, \"Remote Replica Group\": Statistics for "
          "control IOs between an array and a remote mirror across "
          "a Network. Note that statistics for the actual movement "
          "of data to the remote mirror are attributed to the "
          "targeted StorageVolume (or LogicalDisk). Note that a "
          "particular element could be associated to multiple "
          "BlockStorageStatisticalData instances if it had multiple "
          "roles. For example, a storage array could contain "
          "redundant component computer systems that communicate "
          "both with hosts on the front end and disks on the back "
          "end. Such a device could have one "
          "BlockStorageStatisticalData instance where ElementType=3 "
          "and another instance where ElementType=5.If only rated "
          "data is included per RateElementType, this property "
          "shall be set to 0." ),
