    Description ( 
       "The Service that provides support for processing BatchJob "
       "requests. The basic assumption of this model is that a "
       "BatchService accepts a BatchJob for processing, via its "
       "BatchSAP. The Job is then placed on a BatchQueue (indicated by "
       "the QueueForBatchService association). A System takes Jobs "
       "from Queues (indicated by the ExecutionTarget association) and "
       "processes them." )]
