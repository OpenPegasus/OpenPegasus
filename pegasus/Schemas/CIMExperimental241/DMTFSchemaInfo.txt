Source File: cim_schema_2.41.0Experimental-MOFs.zip

To generate the OpenPegasus specific mofs used to load CIM server specific
namespaces the script  pegasus/mak/CreateDmtfSchema was used.

NOTE: The script CreateDmtfSchema creates the directory Schemas/CIM241 which
must then be renamed to CIMExperimental241 to correctly maintain the naming
scheme.

Several manual updates needed to be made in the generated OpenPegasus mofs after
running the script to properly include the prerequisite classes for the
compiler.

The following diff statements define the changes made.
