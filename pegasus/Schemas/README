//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////README - The Scehmas Directories

28 May 2004

This directory contains  a set of subdirectories with the CIM MOF files
and the Makefile that installs a CIMSchema into the Pegasus Repository

The CIMOMxx directories are the official DMTF MOF files for the
versions of CIM defined by the xx (ex. CIM25 for CIM Schema version 2.5).

Preliminary versions of the CIM schemas should have the directory naming:

CIMPRELIMxx

The other directories are CIM MOF files for the Pegasus project
including Pegasus extensions and tests.

New CIM Schemas should be added to this directory each as a complete
subdirectory.

Please use the directory naming

CIMxx
orCIMPRELIMxx

where xx is the version

Note that it is not valid to use names like CIMPrelim281 because the
file names would be xxx28.mof not xxx.281.mof.

Therefore, if you chose to put revision updates (3rd digit changes) into this Schemas
directory, they MUST be put into the directory and replace the previous
subversion.  It is not possible today to have both CIM28 and CIM281 in the
schemas directories simultaneously.

Also to help others understand if there is a revision update please put
a readme into the target directory noting that this update occurred
because it is often difficult to tell if there has been a revision update.
