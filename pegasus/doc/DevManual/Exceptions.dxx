/*
Handling Exceptions in Pegasus

/** Programming with Exceptions

The Pegaus programming model uses exceptions extensively.

It is important that these exceptions be handled in any code that is created.

Where exceptions are used in Pegasus Classes and Methods, they are noted in
the documentation with an indication that the method or class generates an
exception.
