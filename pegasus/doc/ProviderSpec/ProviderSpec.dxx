<P><B><CENTER>DRAFT FOR REVIEW</CENTER></B>
<SMALL><CENTER>version 0.5</CENTER></SMALL>

Pegasus is an open source implementation of the manageability environment defined by the DMTF WBEM standards.

<B>This Document</B>

<P>This document is a specification for the Interfaces between the Pegasus CIM Object Manager and providers compatible with this object manager.


This is not an internals manual for Pegasus.  The Internals for Pegasus developers will be defined in a separate manual that will be available from The Open Group (\URL{http://www.opengroup.org/management}).

NOTE: This a working document today.  It is revised frequently as we learn more about the documentation system and stabilize the Pegasus interfaces.  We apologize for the existing insonsistencies and errors in this working version of the document.

This version of the Pegasus Provider Interface Specification was created at \today
