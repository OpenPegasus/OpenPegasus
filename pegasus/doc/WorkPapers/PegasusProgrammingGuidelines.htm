<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines the basic set of guides and rules for programmers
contributing to the Pegasus Project</p>

<p>NOTE: This is a draft copy for comment.</p>

<p>RULES and GUIDELINES - A number of the guidelines below are absolute rules
that we must follow in the Pegasus project.&nbsp; These are the things that will
help insure portability and effective interoperability of the components.</p>

<p>Other area are &quot;guidelines&quot; that we strongly suggest be followed
so that 1) the code will be readable and usable, 2) we develop a single look to
our source code, etc.&nbsp; In some cases, there may be reasons to bypass some
of these guidelines but we strongly encourage everybody to follow them.&nbsp;
In fact, if there is a real reason we will change to what the group wants and
suggestions.</p>

<h2>Coding Conventions</h2>
<OL>
<LI><b>Indenting Code</b> - Indent by increments of 4 characters (with tabsize of
8).&nbsp; Use the TAB character.&nbsp; This is the accepted norm for open source
  code.

<LI><b>Naming Conventions</b> -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font face="Courier New"> ThisIsAClassName</font> - no underscores.
  <font face="Courier New">
thisIsAMethodName()</font> - no underscores.

Files Names should take advantage of case and avoid underscores.
    Files should have the same name as the class (and same case).
<br>Prepend '_' to private members (including methods). 
<LI><b>Code Line Length</b> - Lines should not span more than 80 columns.
When methods span more than 80 columns, do this:
<pre>
    void MyClass::myMethod(
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             const char* someReallyLongName,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             const char* someOtherReallyLongName);
</pre>
<LI> Use "char* x" rather than "char *x". Either is normally legal for the
  majority of compilers.
<LI><b>Use of <font face="Courier New">const</font></b>. Use <font face="Courier New"> const</font> whenever possible.
Use <font face="Courier New"> const</font> methods whenever possible.
<LI><b>Braces</b> -&nbsp; Put opening brace on a line by itself. Braces must be aligned with control keyword:
<pre>
	for(...)
	{
        ....
	}
</pre>
    Not this:
<pre>	for (...)
	  {
          ....
	  }</pre>
or this:<pre>	for (...){
            ....
       }</pre>
<LI><b>Using Space</b> - No spaces after names.
<br>Separate functions with blank lines.
<pre>    class X
    {
    public:
	    void f();
	    void g();
    };</pre>
  <p>&nbsp;

<LI>	Not "void f ()" but "void f()".

<LI>Avoid this:<br>
  <font face="Courier New">
  callingMyFunction(blah,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blah2,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blah3);</font><br>
    Do this:<br>
  <font face="Courier New">callingMyFunction(<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blah,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blah2,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; blah3);</font>&gt;/pre&gt;<br>
<LI>
  <pre>Avoid this:

	int        x;
	float      y;
</pre>
<LI>Use 0 and not NULL.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<li>Don't separate return type onto its own line:

    Avoid this:
   <pre>
	int
	f()
	{
        ....
	}
   </pre>

<li><b>Comments</b> - Use /** */ rather than /// for DOC++.

<li><b>Conditional Compilation </b>- Avoid use of conditional compilation for obscuring platrform
    differences. Use (or put) routines in appropriate platform files
    or in the System*.cpp files in Common.
</ol>
<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Effective testing is essential to allowing a group to work together in a
common code environment. We have created a structure where unit and even system
level tests can be created and committed to the source tree as part of all
development.&nbsp; Each major directory section includes a tests subdirectory
with individual directories for tests. Please create and commit tests as part of
the normal environment wherever it is possible. All core code should include
tests created in this manner as well</p>

<p>If you change code to extend it or make corrections, please review the
corresponding tests code to 1) add tests to cover the problem corrected 2)
extend tests to cover the new code added.</p>

<p>Be mindful that the tests must run on all supported platforms and
    that a commit may break another platform.</p>

<p>Tests must clean up the effect they have on the repository.</p>

Changes must work on all platforms. Commits must not break any
    platform.

Always write a regression test for everything.
<p>No files with warnings should be committed to CVS.

Test big changes on at least Windows and Unix (or Linux)

<h2>Committing Code to CVS</h2>

<p>Don't commit anything that breaks the build (try a clean slate
    checkout and build).&nbsp; Remember that if the build is broken for you, it
is also broken for everybody that gets the new code.</p>

<p>Always build and run all regression tests before committing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No binaries may be committed to repository.&nbsp;</p>

<p> There are a few exceptions to this rule but binary files cause problems</p>

<h2>Using Outside Code and Libraries</h2>

<p>This is an open source project.&nbsp; All code that is contributed to this
project must be open source and must be made available under the standard
license used by the Pegasus project. Do not use any outside libraries that do
not meet this criteria.&nbsp; Further, every reference to outside code make it
more complex for others to build and work with the project and introduces
potential portability problems.&nbsp; At the same time, there may be real
reasons to use outside code and libraries at times. Thus, for example, the
initial project used the ACE_wrappers libraries extensively but with the
objective of eventually providing a replacement.&nbsp; That replacement has been
produced, partly because ACE was not available on all of the platforms.</p>

<p>All code submitted to the Pegasus core source libraries is to be made available
under the standard license used by Pegasus.&nbsp; If any code is to be taken
from other open source projects, we expect that the code recognize both the
requirements of the Pegasus standard license and the other license (ex. if we
were to share code with the Caldera OpenWBEM) project, we would have to show
both their license and our licenses.</p>

<p>All code input to the Pegasus project must include the license statement.</p>

<p>If there is a case of code that we want to use on the Pegasus project but
that is licensed outside of the above rules, it can be included only with the
specific permission of the Pegasus project management.&nbsp; We will be very
hesitant to do this since it could mean weakening the whole open source nature
of the project and would greatly complicate our license arrangements.</p>

<h2>Using Make</h2>

<p>The Pegasus project has developed a consistent and portable make system that
allows bot localized and global builds on a wide variety of systems from Windows
to Unix to the tandem platforms today.&nbsp; This is based on 1) using the GNU
Make tool as the core of the make system, 2) minimining the use of other tools.
</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;EXPLAIN THE MAKE SYSTEM OR REFERENCE DOC&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<p>All code must be reachable (built) from master makefile. Otherwise it will not be reached when doing mass substitutions, testings of
builds, and license changes.
</p>

<h2>DOCUMENTING
</h2>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS SECTION NEED TO BE COMPLETED&gt;&gt;&gt;
</p>

<h2>Portability Issues</h2>

<OL>
<LI>In .h files the following identifiers must be surrounded by	the PEGASUS_STD() macro (which
pretends std:: to the argument).<br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">	    ostream<br>
	    istream<br>
	    cout<br>
	    cerr<br>
</font><br>
	Do not use this macro in .cpp files. Instead put the following<br>
	at the beginning of the file:<br>
<br>
	    PEGASUS_USING_STD;<br>
<br>
<LI>The following does not compile with some compilers.<br>
<br>
	    class X<br>
	    {<br>
	    public:<br>
<br>
		static const Uint32 COLOR = 225;<br>
	    };<br>
<br>
	Use this instead:<br>
<br>
	    class X<br>
	    {<br>
	    public:<br>
<br>
		static const Uint32 COLOR;<br>
	    };<br>
<br>
	And place this in the .cpp file:<br>
<br>
	    const Uint32 X::COLOR = 255;<br>
<br>
	Or use enumerated types:<br>
<br>
	    class X<br>
	    {<br>
	    public:<br>
<br>
		enum { COLOR = 225 };<br>
	    };<br>
</OL>

<h2>The Source Tree Structure</h2>

<p>We work from a single source tree in CVS.&nbsp; We have a fixed structure for
this structure.</p>

<p>&lt;&lt;&lt;THIS SECTION IS TBD&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
