The remove option of the cimtrust command removes the X509 certificate(s) 
matching the specified 
.B issuer 
and either 
.B serialnumber 
or 
.B subject 
from the truststore. 
.PP
The list option of the cimtrust command lists the X509 certificates 
in the truststore. The list can be filtered by 
.B issuer 
and either 
.B serialnumber 
or 
.B subject.

Certificates in the trust store may be revoked by adding a 
Certificate Revocation List to the CRL store. For more information 
on CRL operations see the 
.B cimcrl(8)

and no action is taken. If the X509 certificate already exists 
in the truststore, an error message is returned. 
.TP
.B -r
Removes certificate(s) from the truststore. If the truststore contains 
multiple certificates matching the specified 
.B issuer

.B subject, 
all the matching certificates are removed. If no certificate exists for 
the specified 
.B issuer 
and either 
.B serialnumber 
or 
.B subject
, an error message is returned and no action is taken.  
.TP

.SH EXAMPLES
Add the X509 self-signed identity certificate in the cert.pem file and 
associate it to certuser guest. This certificate will be added to the 
trusted certificate store: 

cimtrust -a -U guest -f cert.pem -T s

Add the X509 authority root CA certificate in the ca.pem file with no certuser 
association. This certificate will be added to the trusted certificate store but 
may not be used to authenticate a user:

cimtrust -a -f ca.pem -T a

Add the X509 authority issued end-entity certificate in the user.pem file and 
associate it to certuser pegasus. This certificate may be used to authenticate 
user pegasus but will not be added to the trusted certificate store:

cimtrust -a -f user.pem -U pegasus -T e 

Remove the certificate matching the specified issuer and serialnumber from 
the trust store: 

cimtrust -r -i "/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart & Secure/OU=Secure Software Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com" -n 01 

Remove the certificate(s) matching the specified issuer and subject from the trust store: 

cimtrust -r -i "/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart & Secure/OU=Secure Software Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com" -S "/C=US/ST=California/L=Cupertino/O=Smart & Secure/OU=Secure Software Division/CN=dev.admin.ss.com"
