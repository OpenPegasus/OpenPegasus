Effective OpenPegasus 2.14 the man page document has been moved to

    pegaus/rpm/manLinux/man1.Z

and the output files removed from cvs.  Please generate these files yourself
with the Makefile in this directory. 

This Makefile requires several additional tools to generate output including:

   - nroff
   - groff
