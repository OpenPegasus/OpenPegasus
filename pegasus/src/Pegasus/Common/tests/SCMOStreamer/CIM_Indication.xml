<QUALIFIER NAME="Description" TYPE="string" TRANSLATABLE="true">
<VALUE>CIM_Indication is the abstract root class for all notifications about changes in schema, objects and their data, and about events detected by providers and instrumentation. Subclasses represent specific types of notifications. &#10;&#10;To receive an Indication, a consumer (or subscriber) must create an instance of CIM_IndicationFilter describing the criteria of the notification, an instance of CIM_ListenerDestination describing the delivery of the notification, and an instance of CIM_IndicationSubscription associating the Filter and Handler.</VALUE>

<PROPERTY NAME="IndicationIdentifier"  CLASSORIGIN="CIM_Indication" TYPE="string">
<QUALIFIER NAME="Description" TYPE="string" TRANSLATABLE="true">
<VALUE>An identifier for the Indication. This property is similar to a key value in that it can be used for identification, when correlating Indications (see the CorrelatedIndications array). Its value SHOULD be unique as long as correlations are reported, but MAY be reused or left NULL if no future Indications will reference it in their CorrelatedIndications array.To ensure uniqueness, the value of IndicationIdentifier should be constructed using the following &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm: &#10;&lt;OrgID&gt;:&lt;LocalID&gt; &#10;Where &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt; are separated by a colon (:), and where &lt;OrgID&gt; must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the IndicationIdentifier or that is a recognized ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the &lt;Schema Name&gt;_&lt;Class Name&gt; structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness &lt;OrgID&gt; must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in IndicationIdentifier must appear between &lt;OrgID&gt; and &lt;LocalID&gt;. &#10;&lt;LocalID&gt; is chosen by the business entity and should not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. &#10;If the above &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm is not used, the defining entity should assure that the resulting IndicationIdentifier is not re-used across any IndicationIdentifiers that are produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. &#10;For DMTF-defined instances, the &quot;preferred&quot; algorithm should be used with the &lt;OrgID&gt; set to CIM.</VALUE>
