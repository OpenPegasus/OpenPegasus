2) Install (or copy) libuuid.a into a directory that is on
   your library load path.

3) Rebuild Pegasus with PEGASUS_ENABLE_SLP defined in your environment

4) From in this directory, type make <Enter>

This provider has dependencies on the following components:

1) The slp_client library in $PEGASUS_ROOT/src/Unsupportd/slp_client.
	Read the build and installation instructions for that library.
	Make sure that it is installed in a directory that you
	can load shared libraries from.


2) Rebuild the registry:
	cd $(PEGASUS_ROOT)
