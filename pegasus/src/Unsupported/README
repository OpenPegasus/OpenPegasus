Pegasus Unsupported Source Tree
=================================

This area of the Pegasus source code tree contains files that are not
part of the default build environment or test suite environment of
Pegasus.

Criteria for Submission to Unsupported Repository
=================================================

1) Pegasus License

All submissions to this area must be in the form of source code (no
binaries) and must be licensed under the Pegasus source license, which
is as follows:

//
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

All copyright holders of a source file must submit it under this
license, and no other licenses may be asserted.

2) README

All submissions must include a README text file that documents the
purpose of the module and provides contact information for the
module's author.

3) INSTALL

All submissions must include an INSTALL file that documents the build,
install, and test procedures for the module.

4) TEST

All submissions should include a test subdirectory that contains
automated tests to verify the successful build of the source module.

Directory Structure
===================

Each submission to the Unsupported area of the CVS must be a
self-contained environment under its own root directory. For example,
a module Foo.cpp would have the following directory path in the CVS
repository:

$(PEGASUS_ROOT)/src/Unsupported/Foo/Foo.cpp

Alternatively, some modules will have a more structure environment:

$(PEGASUS_ROOT)/src/Unsupported/Foo/src/Foo.cpp
$(PEGASUS_ROOT)/src/Unsupported/Foo/test/Foo_test
$(PEGASUS_ROOT)/src/Unsupported/Foo/doc/Foo.html


Committing Modules to the Unsupported Area
==========================================

Although anyone may offer source code to the Unsupported area
(provided the above criteria are satisfied), only members of the
pegasus-cvs-writers group have authorization to commit source code to
the repository. Therefore, members of the general public need to
obtain steering commette sponsorship for any modules they want to
submit to the Unsupported area of the CVS.
