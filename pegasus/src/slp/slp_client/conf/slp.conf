##### DA Advertisement #######
#
#  DA advertisement provides regular publication over the network of the
#  existence and properties of the SLP Directory Agent. You need to ensure
#  that each network segment receives regular DA advertisements.
#  The best way to do this is through multicast advertising to
#  address 239.255.255.253. However, if multicast is not enabled to cross
#  routers, the next best option is to do directed broadcast.
#
#  DA advertisement should be done regularly but not too frequently because
#  it is unsolicited network traffic.
#
#   syntax is as follows:
# da_advert, <type>, <interval>, <target address>, <sending interface>, <mask>
#
# where <type> is one of multicast, broadcast, or unicast ;
# <interval> is the number of seconds between each advertisement;
# <target address> is the IP address to which the advertisement will be sent ;
# <sending interface> is the IP address from which to send the advertisement;
# <mask> is the IP mask to apply to broadcast advertisements

# next line is a multicast to the SLP group
da_advert, multicast, 1000, 239.255.255.253, 0.0.0.0
# next line is a directed broadcast to
#da_advert, broadcast, 1000, 137.69.141.112, 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.0
# next line is a directed broadcast to 127.69.142.255
#da_advert, broadcast, 1000, 137.69.142.112, 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.0
# next line is a directed broadcast to 127.69.143.255
#da_advert, broadcast, 1000, 137.69.143.112, 0.0.0.0, 255.255.255.0
# next line is an example of a  unicast advertisement
#da_advert, unicast, 1000, 137.69.141.39, 0.0.0.0


##### Active DA Discovery #####
#
# Active DA discovery allows the DA agent to actively query for other
# SLP directory agents.
#
# Active DA discovery can be done more frequently than DA Advertisement
# but also can generate needless traffic if done too frequently. You should
# experiment with the interval for each DA discovery line.
#
#   syntax is as follows:
# da_disc,  <type>, <interval>, <target address>, <sending interface>, <mask>
# the syntax is the same as for DA Advertisement, above.
da_disc, multicast, 200, 239.255.255.253, 0.0.0.0
