INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


1  Introduction

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [1] allows the use of
   multicast and broadcast discovery requests.  The SLP exclusion
   directive is an extension to SLP that optimizes the use of
   multicasting and broadcasting to find services on an intranet. This
   document hereafter refers to multicast discovery but all its contents
   apply to broadcast discovery as well.


1.1 Present SLPv2 Multicast Behavior

   Multicast discovery requests allow an SLP User Agent to discover
   services with no prior configuration. Multicast discovery requests
   are not sent reliably and must be retransmitted in order to find all
   services of the desired type on the network.

   When SLP v2 SrvRqst, SrvTypeRqst, and AttrRqst messages are
   multicast, they contain a <PRList> of previous respondents. Initially
   the <PRList> is empty. When these requests are unicast, the <PRList>
   is always empty.

   Any DA or SA which sees its address in the <PRList> does not respond
   to the request (as specified in RFC 2608).

   The User Agent then retransmits the discovery request until the
   <PRList> causes no further responses to be elicited or the previous
   responder list and the request will not fit into a single datagram or
   until CONFIG_MC_MAX seconds elapse[1].

   The PR list is an effective mechanism for suppressing duplicate
   responses in smaller environments. However, because of the way PR
   lists are encoded with the SLP v2 header, the PR List has a limit of
   as few as 90 IPv4 addressees, and even fewer IPv6 addresses. This
   means in most environments a User Agent may suppress duplicate
   responses from approximately 90 host addresses at best.


1.2 Optimizations Made by Exclusion Directive

   The Exclusion Directive extension presented in this document allows a
   User Agent (UA) to direct those Directory Agents (DAs) and Service
   Agents (SAs) from which it has already received responses not to
   respond to retransmissions of a particular query. Hence subsequent
   retransmissions only generate responses from agents from which the
   requester has not already received a response.

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


   This extension can be used in conjunction with the SLP v2 PR list.
   SAs and DAs which do not understand the Exclusion Directive extension
   will ignore it. With the use of the Exclusion Directive extension,
   SLP v2 User Agents may perform multicast discovery with a high degree
   of success and efficiency, even when the number of respondents
   reaches into the thousands. .


1.3 Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in RFC 2119 [2].

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


2  Exclusion Extension Format

   The fields in an Exclusion extension form an Exclusion Directive that
   tells receiving agents not to respond to a specific request from a
   specific host for a specific time interval.

   Each Exclusion Directive is     fully  contained within one  SLP
   v2 extension block. However, a single SLP v2  request message may
   contain multiple Exclusion Directives.  For example, a single Service
   Request may  contain three Exclusion  Directives  within three
   distinct SLP v2 extension blocks.


2.1 Exclusion Extension Fields

   The Exclusion extension has the following format:



   0             1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Extension ID = 0x000?        |     Next Extension Offset     |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | Offset, contd.|     size      |        Exclusion XID          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                             Nonce                             |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |  Exclusion Interval           |    Number of Entries          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                     Exclusion Entries                         |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | # auth blocks                 | authentication block (if any) |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+



2.1.1 Size Field

   The size field specifies the size, in bytes, of each
   address entry. A size value of 4 bytes MUST be encoded as
   an IP v4 address in network byte order. A size value of
   16 bytes MUST be encoded as an IP v6 address in network
   byte order. Other address sizes are assumed to be opaque
   data and will not be interoperable among different imple-
   mentations

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


2.1.1.1 Using the Size Field to Calculate Length of Entries

   The size of the Exclusion Entries field MUST be calcu-
   lated by multiplying the value of the Size field by the
   value of the Number of Entries field.


2.1.2 Exclusion XID

   The Exclusion XID identifies the SLP request to which the
   enclosing Exclusion Directive applies. An Exclusion
   Directive always applies to exactly one specific XID from
   exactly one host IP address.

   It is possible that the value of XID field in the Exclu-
   sion Directive and the XID in the SLP header of the mes-
   sage containing the Exclusion Directive will be differ-
   ent. This is a subtle but important point: the SLP v2
   header XID and the Exclusion XID are not equivalent. See
   section 3.0 for details of how the exclusion XID works.


2.1.3 Nonce

   The Nonce adds a unique value to each Exclusion Directive
   that makes it difficult to mount a denial of service
   attack by replaying Exclusion Directives. The Nonce is a
   128-bit field which MUST contain a cryptographic-quality
   random unique value; or alternatively must be filled with
   zero bytes. (If the Nonce is filled with zero bytes, it
   is ignored.)

   The usage of the Nonce is explained further in section
   4.3.


2.1.4 Exclusion Interval

   The Exclusion Interval indicates the lifetime, in sec-
   onds, of the containing Exclusion Directive. The interval
   begins when the SA or DA receives the Exclusion Direc-
   tive. Exclusion Directives SHOULD have an interval from
   one to several seconds. However, the Exclusion Interval
   may need to be increased for unusually large networks or
   media with high latency characteristics, such as satel-
   lite links.

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


2.1.5 Exclusion Entries

   The Exclusion Entries field is the list of host IP
   addresses that are subject to the containing Exclusion
   Directive. The length of the Exclusion Entries field is
   the number of IP addresses in the list multiplied by the
   size of each IP address.

   The size of each IP address is determined by the value of
   the size field. Each Exclusion Directive therefore may
   only contain IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses, but not
   both.


2.1.5.1 Dual-stack IP Environments

   In environments using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses it may
   be necessary to deliver two Exclusion Directives where
   otherwise one would be sufficient. E.g., one Directive
   containing IPv4 addresses and another Directive contain-
   ing IPv6 addresses. One way to accomplish this is to pack
   two separate Exclusion Directives into a single SLP
   request. Another way involves using dummy request mes-
   sages to deliver Exclusion Directives. Dummy request mes-
   sages are covered in section 3.1 below.


2.1.6 Authentication Blocks

   The Number of Auth Blocks indicates how many authentica-
   tion blocks are contained in the containing Exclusion
   Directive. The format of the authentication block is cov-
   ered in section 4 below.

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


2.2 Exclusion Directive Functionality

   The purpose of the Exclusion Directive is to cause SAs or
   DAs to silently discard specific SLP requests that origi-
   nate from specific IP addresses. This purpose aids in the
   use of multicasting to discover services in large network
   environments. The Exclusion Directive makes multicast
   discovery  more reliable and efficient by:


     1. Providing a more compact mechanism to silence previ-
        ous responders.

     2. Magnifying the effect of the silencing mechanism by
        specifying a quiet interval.


2.2.1 Exclusion Directive State Table (EDST)

   When the Exclusion Directive is present in an SLP
   request, the receiving agent uses the directive to create
   and maintain state information that causes the receiving
   agent to ignore and discard matching requests (possibly
   including the request containing the Exclusion Direc-
   tive).

   The Exclusion Directive State Table (EDST) is the collec-
   tion of information describing all current Exclusion
   Directives received by the agent. EDST entries are a
   record with five fields: Source Address, Source Port,
   exclusion XID , exclusion nonce value, and expiration
   time. (The nonce value MAY be zero filled.)

   The Exclusion Directive only applies to SLP v2 messages
   that have the multicast flag set. The SA or DA MUST
   respond to SLP v2 messages that do not have the multicast
   flag set as specified in [1].

   If the incoming request message matches a current record
   in the receiving agent's EDST, and if the incoming
   request's Multicast flag is set in the SLP header, the DA
   or SA MUST silently discard the message.

   When the Exclusion Interval of an Exclusion Directive has
   expired, the SA or DA MUST delete the corresponding
   record in its EDST and resume processing SLP v2 multicast

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


   request as if that Exclusion Directive was never
   received.

   If an incoming request does not contain an Exclusion
   Directive, the receiving agent MUST process that request
   without regard to the local EDST. (In other words, pro-
   cess the request normally.)



3  Exclusion Directives in SLP v2 Request Messages

   An SA or DA may encounter the Exclusion Directive in Ser-
   vice Request, Attribute Request, and Service Type Request
   messages. In each case, the request may also contain a PR
   list as described in [1].

   A UA MUST NOT include an Exclusion Directive in a unicast
   SLP v2 request message. DAs and SAs MUST ignore Exclusion
   Directives that are erroneously included in unicast
   request messages.

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


   If the SA or DA supports the Exclusion Directive, it MUST
   perform the following steps when processing an SLP v2
   Request message.

     1. If the request message is unicast or if the receiv-
        ing agent does not recognize the Exclusion Direc-
        tive, go to step 6 below.

     2. If the incoming request does not have an Exclusion
        Directive, proceed to step 6.

     3. Extract the Exclusion Directive from the request.
        Search the Directive's Exclusion Entries list for
        the receiving agent's IP address. If not found, pro-
        ceed to step 6.

     4. Extract the source address and port from the UDP
        header and the Exclusion XID and nonce from the
        Exclusion Directive. The receiving agent MUST ensure
        that its EDST contains a record for this directive,
        creating a new EDST record if necessary. (This step
        is also a convenient time to delete expired entries
        from the EDST.)

     5. Extract the source address and port from the incom-
        ing request's UDP header. Extract the XID from the
        request's SLP v2 header. If the incoming request has
        an Exclusion Directive, extract the nonce from the
        directive.

        Search the EDST for an entry containing matching
        values for these data (Optionally ignoring the nonce
        from the EDST entry if the incoming request does not
        contain an exclusion directive). Upon finding a
        matching EDST entry, silently discard the request.
        Otherwise continue.

     6. If the SA or DA has not discarded the request up to
        this point, evaluate the request normally as out-
        lined in [1].

   It is worth repeating that the Exclusion Directive only
   applies to SLP v2 request messages that have the R
   (Request Multicast) flag turned on in the SLP v2 header.
   Agents MUST NOT silently discard unicast request messages
   regardless of exclusion directives or EDST entries.

INTERNET DRAFT     SLP Exclusion Directive   Exp. May 2003


   Note that additional steps may be necessary if the Exclu-
   sion directive contains one or more authentication
   blocks. These steps are outlined in section 4.


3.1 Dummy Service Request Message with Exclusion Directive

   A "dummy" request message is one that has zero-length
   fields for the entire request body, exclusive of the SLP
   v2 header and the Exclusion directive.

   Using a dummy SLP request message for the sole purpose of
   transporting an Exclusion Directive may be helpful in two
   cases:

     1. The Exclusion Directive is too large to fit within a
        single request datagram alongside the SLP header,
        service type, predicate, and other request data.
        However, it will fit in a datagram with just itself
        and the SLP header.

     2. The Exclusion Directive is larger than the sum of
        the network MTU and the SLP Header. The agent can
        divide the Exclusion Entries list across two or more
        Exclusion Directives and transport those Directives
        within a corresponding number of dummy SLP request
        messages.

	        This method can support Exclusion Entry lists that
        contain thousands of addresses.

   When an SA or DA receives a dummy SLP request that con-
   tains an Exclusion Directive, the receiving agent MUST
   extract the Exclusion Directive from the dummy request
   and ensure that the local EDST contains a record corre-
   sponding to the Exclusion Directive. This is described in
   section 3, step 4 above.


   A Dummy request message MUST have the R (Request Multi-
   cast) flag turned on in the SLP v2 header. This causes
   SLP v2 SAs and DAs that are unaware of the Exclusion
   Directive to silently discard dummy request messages due
   to a parsing error (instead of responding to the sending
   agent with an error code).

3.1.2 Processing the Dummy Service Request

   Dummy Service Request messages MUST be processed as out-
   lined in section 3 above. The result is that the receiv-
   ing agents which support the Exclusion Directive will
   process the Directive, while all other agents will
   silently discard the message due to a parsing error.

   After processing the Exclusion Directive, the receiving
   agent will produce a parse error. Because the service
   request has the multicast flag set, the receiving agent
   will not send an error response to the originating agent.

   Note that if the Exclusion Directive contains an authen-
   tication block, the SA or DA SHOULD validate the signa-
   ture of the Exclusion Directive. Authentication of Exclu-
   sion Directives is covered in section 4.

3.1.3 Using the Exclusion Directive and PR List Together

   The steps below show how to use the Exclusion Directive
   in combination with the SLP PR list to perform multicast
   discovery (substitute actual XIDs in real usage):

     1. Send a new Service Request with no PR list and no
        Exclusion Directive; process the replies and remem-
        ber the respondents as RL1.

     2. Build an exclusion list and remember it as list EL1.

     3. Immediately re-transmit the Service Request from (1)
        with no PR list and but with an Exclusion Directive
        that contains Exclusion List EL1; process the
        replies and remember the respondents as RL2.

     4. The intersection of EL1 and RL2 are agents that do
        not support the Exclusion Directive. Create PRL1 =
        EL1 n RL2. Build EL2 = RL2 - PRL1.

     5. Immediately re-transmit the Service Request from (3)
        including PRL1 in the SLP header and substituting
        EL2 for EL1 in the Exclusion Directive. If no
        responses the discovery cycle is complete.

     6. Repeat the previous thre steps n times using ELn-1,
        RLn, PRLn-1, and ELn until the UA receives no
        responses for the configured timeout period.

   In steps 1 - 6 above, it is important that each Service
   Request (steps 1, 3, and 5) have the same XID in the SLP
   Header ; and equally that each Exclusion Directive also
   has the same value in the XID field.

4  Authenticating Exclusion Directives

   To prevent denial of service attacks against UAs, all
   agents that recognize the Exclusion Directive SHOULD sup-
   port authentication of the Exclusion Directive.

   Authenticating Exclusion Directives places the additional
   burden upon the User Agent of signing data. In standard
   SLP v2, UAs only need to verify signatures. The addi-
   tional ability to generate signatures means that UAs must
   be issued private key material.

4.2 Exclusion Directive Authentication Rules

   To sign or verify the signature of an Exclusion Direc-
   tive, the SLP agent MUST use the following components of
   the Exclusion Directive as if they were a single continu-
   ous byte-aligned buffer:

       16-bit Exclusion XID

       32-bit Nonce

       16-bit Exclusion Interval

       8-bit Exclusion Entry size

       16-bit Number of Entries

       Variable-length Exclusion Entries.


5  Using the NONCE Value to Prevent Replay Attacks

   Despite the use of signatures to authenticate Exclusion
   Directives, UAs may still be vulnerable to a replay
   denial of service attack.  To prevent this possibility,
   SLP Agents that recognize the Exclusion directive SHOULD
   make use of the nonce value as described in this section.

   Every Exclusion Directive contains a 128-bit nonce field,
   which MUST contain a 128-bit cryptographicly random value
   or be filled with zeros. If the nonce is filled with
   zeroes, the UA is open to a denial-of service attack.

   Because the nonce field is included in signature genera-
   tion and validation, each signed Exclusion Directive can
   be cryptographically unique. Unsigned Exclusion Direc-
   tives can also be cryptographically unique but their
   source can be spoofed.

   By using the nonce correctly, Exclusion Directives can be
   specific to:

     1. The source address and port of the requesting UA.

     2. The XID of the request.

     3. A cryptographically unique value for each and every
        request. To make this work, SAs and DAs MUST include
        the nonce value, along with the UA source address
        and the request XID when deciding whether or not an
        Exclusion Directive applies to a request message.


5.1 UA Use of the Nonce to Prevent Denial of Service Attack

   The UA is the SLP component vulnerable to a denial of
   service attack so it is responsible for using an appro-
   priate algorithm to generate a nonce with the requisite
   random characteristics.

   For each Exclusion Directive:

     1. Generate a random 128-bit integer to use as the
        nonce.

     2. Initialize an Exclusion Directive, including the XID
        of the request that is subject to response suppres-
        sion.

     3. Insert the nonce value from (1) into the Exclusion
        Directive.

     4. Optionally sign the Exclusion Directive as outlined
        in the section on Authentication above.

     5. Use a Exclusion Directive containing the nonce in
        all requests and dummy Service Requests for the XID
        in step (2).

     6. IMPORTANT - use a DIFFERENT, cryptographically gen-
        erated nonce for each request XID for which you are
        issuing an Exclusion directive.

5.2 DA and SA Use of the Nonce

   SA's DAs that recognize the Exclusion Directive MUST use
   the nonce value to initialize EDST entries and to evalu-
   ate Exclusion Directives in request messages.


5.2.1 Zero-filled Nonce

   UAs that don't have the ability to generate unique nonce
   values MUST fill the nonce field of the Exclusion Direc-
   tive with zeros. This opens the agent up to a denial of
   service attack, however. (See below).


5.3 Theory Behind the Nonce
   The nonce is a simple mechanism to make it as difficult
   as possible for an attacker to predict the composition of
   SLP service requests that a particular UA may issue in
   the near future.

   Most UA's use the XID field in the SLP 2 header as a
   sequential counter. Hence an attacker that has a copy of
   a recent SLP request can guess the XID of the next
   request the agent will make. Using the Exclusion Direc-
   tive, an attacker can cause DA's and SA's not to respond
   to subsequent SLP requests made by the attacked agent.

   However, the inclusion of the nonce value in the Exclu-
   sion Directive makes it infeasible for an attacker to
   guess the composition of future requests made by the UA.
   This is true because the nonce, unlike the XID, is a ran-
   dom value. Also, the nonce is large enough to make guess-
   ing its value in the next request too difficult for the
   attacker.

6  Security Considerations

   Implementing the Exclusion Directive without using the
   nonce value opens SLP v2 UAs up to a trivial denial of
   service attack, which would nullify the ability of the UA
   to perform discovery.

   Implementing the Exclusion Directive with authentication
   but without using the nonce value may leave the UA open
   to a more sophisticated replay attack using previously

   signed and multicast request messages.

   UAs that support the Exclusion Directive SHOULD authenti-
   cate their requests as outlined in section 4 and SHOULD
   include the nonce value in all Exclusion Directives.

   SAs and DAs that support the Exclusion Directive SHOULD
   be able to verify signed Exclusion Directives and MUST
   store the nonce value in the EDST entry for that direc-
   tive.

   Nonce values generated by UAs MUST  be cryptographically
   unique and random values if they are to provide any safe-
   guard against a replay attack.
