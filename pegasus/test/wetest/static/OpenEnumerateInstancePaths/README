This set of static tests only tests error responses and largely those
that might result from parameter errors.  We do not test good
responses in general because that would mean generating multple
requests (i.e. open, Pull, etc.) which is significantly more complex in this
static environment.  That is more easily accomplished with the dynamic
tools (see the client tools pullop and PullError.

The alternate would be to generate just the open with a very limited
response so that we would at least be able to confirm the XML structure
for request and response. For this we would need a class that is guaranteed
to return just a single instance.

Further since the Open and Pull operations return host information in the
path, fixed good responses do not really work.
